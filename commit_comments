added: call to import ueventd.ac8227l.rc in ueventd.rc - might not be needed?
    todo: consider combining ueventd.ac8227l.rc into ueventd.rc
temp: init is calling to start logd, but the binary is not there - commented import statement
fixed: fs_mgr looking for fstab.ac8227l in root, apparently the BoardConfig.mk line pointing to /etc/recovery.fstab is not followed - created /fstab.ac8227l and renamed etc/recovery.fstab to recovery.fstab.bak
    commented TARGET_RECOVERY_FSTAB line in BoardConfig.mk
