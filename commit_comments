fixed: invalid command error in init.rc  - commented legacy system properties call
fixed: SElinux error message regarding /postinstall context, /postinstall is not present, commented call
fixed: typos in init.recovery.ac8227l.rc comments
fixed: ueventd.rc delaying .coldboot_done signal by trying to set permissions on non-existent /dev/hw_random - commented call
added: call to import ueventd.ac8227l.rc in ueventd.rc - might not be needed?
    todo: consider combining ueventd.ac8227l.rc into ueventd.rc
temp: init is calling to start logd, but the binary is not there - commented import statement
fixed: fs_mgr looking for fstab.ac8227l in root, apparently the BoardConfig.mk line pointing to /etc/recovery.fstab is not followed - created /fstab.ac8227l and renamed etc/recovery.fstab to recovery.fstab.bak
    commented TARGET_RECOVERY_FSTAB line in BoardConfig.mk
	
-------------------------------------------------------

fixed: apparently forgot to save hw_random change to ueventd.rc, changed again
added: TW_BRIGHTNESS_PATH, TW_MAX_BRIGHTNESS, TW_DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS to BoardConfig.mk to address kernel log messages about twrp crashing while setting brightness
added: TW_NO_SCREEN_BLANK to see if it stops the strange graphical artifacts happening on startup
fixed: fs_mgr wants the fstab.ac8277l file, but twrp apparently wants /etc/recovery.fstab - revert previous change to recovery.fstab filename
