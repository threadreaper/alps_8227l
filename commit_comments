fixed: invalid command error in init.rc  - commented legacy system properties call
fixed: SElinux error message regarding /postinstall context, /postinstall is not present, commented call
fixed: typos in init.recovery.ac8227l.rc comments
fixed: ueventd.rc delaying .coldboot_done signal by trying to set permissions on non-existent /dev/hw_random - commented call
added: call to import ueventd.ac8227l.rc in ueventd.rc - might not be needed?
    todo: consider combining ueventd.ac8227l.rc into ueventd.rc
temp: init is calling to start logd, but the binary is not there - commented import statement
fixed: fs_mgr looking for fstab.ac8227l in root, apparently the BoardConfig.mk line pointing to /etc/recovery.fstab is not followed - created /fstab.ac8227l and renamed etc/recovery.fstab to recovery.fstab.bak
    commented TARGET_RECOVERY_FSTAB line in BoardConfig.mk
	
-------------------------------------------------------

fixed: apparently forgot to save hw_random change to ueventd.rc, changed again
added: TW_BRIGHTNESS_PATH, TW_MAX_BRIGHTNESS, TW_DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS to BoardConfig.mk to address kernel log messages about twrp crashing while setting brightness
added: TW_NO_SCREEN_BLANK to see if it stops the strange graphical artifacts happening on startup
reverted: fs_mgr wants the fstab.ac8277l file, but twrp apparently wants /etc/recovery.fstab - revert previous change to recovery.fstab filename

-------------------------------------------------------

reverted: ueventd.rc is not responsible for error message about hw_random.   it's coming from init.   reverted previous change to ueventd.rc
fixed: typo in fstab.ac8227l filename
tried: adjust TW_MAX_BRIGHTNESS in BoardConfig.mk to a lower value and see if it influences "crash" messages on setting brightness level
tried: change TW_NO_SCREEN_BLANK to TW_SCREEN_BLANK_ON_BOOT

------------------------------------------------------

fixed: removed TWRP-specific flags from fstab.ac8227l
tried: comment out TW_MAX_BRIGHTNESS to check effects on "crash" messages 
added: TARGET_USES_LOGD in BoardConfig.mk so logd gets built into our recovery
    reverted: previous temporary workaround logd error, uncommented import /init.recovery.logd.rc in init.rc
reverted: previous change to pointer to recovery.fstab in BoardConfig.mk

------------------------------------------------------

added: PLATFORM_SDK_VERSION in BoardConfig.mk because TWRP checks it to add some additional libraries
tried: lowered TW_DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS to 80
added: TWRP_INCLUDE_LOGCAT may also be required to get build system to produce logd binary in output

-----------------------------------------------------

checkout TeamWin/android-6.0 branch in bootable/recovery - rebuilding

-----------------------------------------------------

revert: no difference besides missing features, checking out TeamWin/android-9.0 again
rebuilding as engineering build

-----------------------------------------------------
