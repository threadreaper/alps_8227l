pull declaration of recovery service out of init.recovery.service.rc and just put it in init.rc  -- there may be a reason to keep this, see comments in bootable/recovery/etc/Android.mk
consider merging ueventd.ac8227l.rc into ueventd.rc as well
create a branch for getting adb working in recovery mode
address "Alternate GPT is invalid, using primary GPT"
fix graphical artifacts on recovery boot
add build type check to creation of SELinux set_permissive service in init.rc
address all the SELinux denials happening during recovery init - bypassed for now with permissive mode set
touchscreen driver complaining about screen dimensions larger than resolution 1085x600 vx 1024x600
/dev/.coldboot_done is still timing out - the error is coming from init, not ueventd - pretty sure this is a regression but i have no idea when i introduced it
twrp brightness flags work, but twrp is still causing some kind of a "crash" when it sets the screen brightness.
	oddly, after passing a value of 150 to set screen brightness, twrp has its little fit, then comes back and sets the brightness to 255, no "crash" message
	after this second call, but it's not obeying the brightness level set in the BoardConfig.   adjusted TW_MAX_BRIGHTNESS to 200, no second call to set
	brightness after the first one crashes, but more fallout from whatever is crashing, cpus killed and restarted, lots of gpio errors, SE_linux appears to 
	reinit maybe?   This probably needs to be a high priority.   Doesn't seem to affect anything in the user experience, but the error logs indicate it's 
	pretty disruptive to a lot of background processes.
excessive debug logging from touchscreen driver - but this may be in the kernel where i can't address it
logd reinit needs SELinux domain defined
