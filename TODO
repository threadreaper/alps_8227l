figure out why logd is not being found && re-enable it in init.rc
pull declaration of recovery service out of init.recovery.service.rc and just put it in init.rc
consider merging ueventd.ac8227l.rc into ueventd.rc as well
create a branch for getting adb working in recovery mode
DONE DID IT * address twrp crash on setting backlight brightness
address "Alternate GPT is invalid, using primary GPT"
fix graphical artifacts on recovery boot
add build type check to creation of SE_linux set_permissive service
address all the SE_linux denials happening during recovery init - bypassed for now with permissive mode set
