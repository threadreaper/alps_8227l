pull declaration of recovery service out of init.recovery.service.rc and just put it in init.rc  -- there may be a reason to keep this, see comments in bootable/recovery/etc/Android.mk
consider merging ueventd.ac8227l.rc into ueventd.rc as well
create a branch for getting adb working in recovery mode
address "Alternate GPT is invalid, using primary GPT"
fix graphical artifacts on recovery boot
add build type check to creation of SELinux set_permissive service in init.rc

excessive debug logging from touchscreen driver - but this may be in the kernel where i can't address it
logd reinit needs SELinux domain defined
